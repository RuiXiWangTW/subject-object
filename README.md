Code for running the experiments of final project of 6.8611 (Natural Language Processing @ MIT) modified from the code by Papadimitriou, Futrell, and Mahowald "When classifying grammatical role, BERT doesn't care about word order... except when it matters"

# How to use the code

`experiment1.sh` replicates the experiments from the original 
`experiment2.ipynb` runs the experiments of prototypical swapped sentences.
`experiment3.sh` runs the experiment3 on larger models.
`data_plotting/ReadingResultsExp.ipynb` plots the results.
Please see 6_8611_paper.pdf for more details
